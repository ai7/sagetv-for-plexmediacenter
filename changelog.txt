                              ChangeLog

2015-05-06  Raymond Chi <raychi@gmail.com>
  * Added option to add/delete/refresh library to sync tool.
      - To bypass a PLEX web UI bug for adding library
  * Skip setting resume pos if within 5% of ending.

2015-04-27  Raymond Chi <raychi@gmail.com>

  * Set resume position in PLEX video during Agent scan.
  * Added sageplex_sync tool to sync watch status independently
      - standalone tool to synchronize watched/resume status
      - both python and win32 packaged binary provided
  * Tested on Mac. Works, no code changes required.

  * Fixed movie detection in both scanners.
      - TV scanner will now skip recorded movies.
      - Movie scanner will only pull in recorded movies.
      - Both will still only pull in recorded contents.
  * Rotate scanner logs when size exceeds certain limit.

  * general code cleanup on all files
      - fixed tab/space usage on all files so it looks correct
        everywhere (browser, notepad, etc)
      - standarized on indent size 4 for all source files.
      - removed nested/multi-level if statements when possible so the
        code blocks are not indented all the way to the right. ie,
        instead of multi-level "if cond1 then if cond2 .." style where
        the main code block is heavily indented to the right, used "if
        not cond1 then continue (loop)" style so subsequent test for
        cond2 and beyond have the same indent level. This makes the
        code much easier to read/follow/debug.
      - wrapped long comment/code lines (emacs justify option)

  * fully documented all source files
      - added comments to each source file regarding what the file is
        for, and useful links for additional info/background.
      - used javadoc style comments for javascript files.
      - used python docstring for in python files.
      - the source code should be significantly easier to follow for
        new contributors.
  
  * sagex\services\plex.js code cleanup/fix:
      - fixed loop: continue -> break
      - stop outer loop when mediaFile has a value. The previous code
        would continue to run the loop even if we found a match.
      - fixed bug where occasionally getAbsolutePath() gets called on
        an undefined object

  * allow user to configure scanner/agent via a sageplex_cfg.json file
      - code will try to find the configuration file in plex data
        directory. user can override this with an environment variable.
      - removed all hard coded configuration settings from various
        source files.

  * created a common/sageplex module to hold common code that are used
    by both scanner and agent.
      - created plexlog.py wrapper for logging inside scanner/agent
      - created config.py to handle scanner/agent configuration
      - created sagex.py to handle all SageTV sagex API calls

  * Scanners code cleanup/refactoring
      - refactored common code into sageplex module
      - replaced printf with logging via the plexlog module
      - updated logging to use debug/info/warn level as appropriate
      - track some statistics during loop: current, added, total
      - use statistics in log during and after loop to show progress
      - fixed check for movie/tv detection
      - updated code in main loop.
      - only call Stack.Scan() after all files have been processed and
        files were added to mediaList.
      - use simple python truthy/falsy test instead of testing for
        empty string, None, etc explicitly.
      - removed simplejson module, not needed as plex has it in
        addition to providing a JSON interface.

  * Agent code cleanup/refactoring
      - refactored common code into sageplex module
      - fixed problem of fanart downloading. the original code was
        setting show/episode level fanart without checking whether the
        response from sagex is valid or not. Although plex handled
        this, this prevented subsequent episode with correct fanart
        from updating a show fanart that was set to non image from
        previous episodes (because its already set). With the updated
        code, show will get fanart if at least one of the episodes in
        it has fanart.
      - synchronized calls into sagex API. there seems to be some
        issues when multiple thrads are calling into it heavily, as is
        the case when the library contains a lot of data on initial
        scan. This can be turned on/off via configuration file.
      - various performance improvements. Agent.search() has been
        greatly simplified with no call to sagex. Agent.update()
        correctly craws its season/episode tree to get the files and
        query sage directly without relying on a mfid set in search().
        the number of calls we make to sagex is reduced quite a bit.
      - no longer rely on getMediaFilesForShow() api. This is a very
        slow API and is used for each show. the code has been updated
        to get the files directly from PLEX media object rather than
        asking Sage.
      - Modularized Agent.update() code into various functions.
      - Update show information when we encounter 1st episode in
        season/episode loop, not before the loop as a separate step.
      - use show premier date for Show year, not episode air date.
      - correctly set multiple show category.
      - lots of misc code cleanup.

  * Updated source tree directory structure.
      - use 'src' instead of 'branches' as branch have a different
        meaning in version control.
      - organized sources into logical groupings (sagetv/plex,
        agent/scanner, etc).
      - included readme files at each level.
      - use Makefile to build the output zip file for user to
        download with the appropriate folder structure. this allowed
        the src tree to be simplified.
