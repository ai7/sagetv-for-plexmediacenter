== Introduction==

This document will not cover specific steps on how to install the SageTV Server or the Plex Media Server. It is also assumed that the user is somewhat familiar with the [http:// Plex Media Manager] (browser-based access to the Plex media library / database).

== Installation ==
=== Installing sagex-services plugin for SageTV Server ===

[http://code.google.com/p/customsagetv/wiki/SageTVapi sagex-services] is SageTV plugin that allows remote access to the SageTV API for developers that wish to access various aspects of the SageTV server. This plug-in must be installed on your SageTV server.

  # Open SageTV Placeshifter, turn on an Extender or open the SageTV UI on the server 
  # Go to the SageTV Plugin Manager by following the menus to Setup -> SageTV Plugins -> All Available Plugins
  # From the General tab, scroll to "sagex-services - SageTV Remote API Services" and select it.
  # Install the plugin, and restart SageTV server when prompted. *Note: this will also install the Jetty Web Server.*
Optional: configure the user name, password, and port for the Jetty Web Server (by default, they are respectively: sage frey and 8080)
  # Open SageTV Placeshifter, turn on an Extender or open the SageTV UI on the server 
  # Go to the SageTV Plugin Manager by following the menus to Setup -> SageTV Plugins -> Installed Plugins
  # From the General tab, scroll to the Jetty Web Server plugin and select it. An options dialog is displayed
  # Choose Configure Plugin. A screen with the plugin's configuration settings is displayed
  # Update the user name, password, and port as you like. Be sure to select "Restart Web Server" when you're done. *Please note: SSL connections are not currently supported in  the SageTV for Boxee app*
  # Make a note of the user name, password and port since these will be used to configure the SageTV for Boxee app
Note: the Jetty Web Server is installed as a part of installing the sagex-services plugin but will not be used by Plex Media Server. See: [http://tools.assembla.com/sageplugins/wiki/Jetty Jetty Web Server plugin wiki] for complete information.

=== Installing the SageTV Custom Code for Plex Media Server ===

*Part 1*

  # Download the [http://code.google.com/p/sagetv-for-plexmediacenter/downloads/list sagetv-for-plexmediacenter.zip] file
  # Find where your Plex Media Server main folder is:
    * OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server
    * Windows 7: C:\Users\_your_user_name_\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server
    * Vista: C:\Documents and Settings\_your_user_name_\Application Data\Plex Media Server
    * Linux ???
  # Unzip the zip file, targeting the top level Plex folder from above.
  
The following folder/files will be installed:
{{{
Scanner
--Movies
----SageTV Movie Scanner.py
--Series
----simplejson
------files
----SageTV Scanner.py
Plug-ins
--BMTAgent.bundle
----Contents
------Code
--------__init__.py
--------BMTAgent.properties
------Resources (stuff)
------Info.plist
------VERSION
}}} 

*Part 2*

Install the plex.js file on the SageTV server:

  # Download the [http://code.google.com/p/sagetv-for-plexmediacenter/downloads/list sagex.zip] file
  # Unzip the zip file into SageTV\SageTV\sagex\services
  # plex.js should be listed 

== Configuration ==

Two files in the Plex Media Server will need to be updated manually with the location of the SageTV server:

  # Plug-ins\BMTAgent.bundle\Contents\Code\BMTAgent.properties
  # Scanners\Series\SageTV Scanner.py

Update each with the correct IP address:

*BMTAgent.properties*, update the SAGEX_HOST line:
  * SAGEX_HOST=http://user:pass@IPAddress:PortNo
    e.g. http://sage:frey@192.168.1.12:8080

*SageTV Scanner.py*, update the SAGEX_HOST line:
  * SAGEX_HOST = 'http://user:pass@IPAdress:PortNo'
    e.g. 'http://sage:frey@192.168.1.12:8080'

    NOTE: *in the second file, single quotes are needed*

    NOTE: only use user:pass in the URL if your web server is password protected. You can test access via: 
    http://IPAddress:PortNo/sagex/api

== Setup and Scanning ==

Once all the files have been installed, use the Plex Media Manager to add a new "section", containing SageTV recordings.

=== Set Up TV Shows for Scanning ===
  * Using your browser, navigate to the Plex Media Manager page
    e.g. http://localhost:32400/manage/index.html if accessing the manager from the same computer that Plex Media Server was installed.
  * Click on "TV Shows"
  * Enter the "Name:" you want the Section/Entry to show up as in Plex, e.g. Recorded TV Shows

  * Click on the Add button
  * Browse to and select your SageTV recordings folder(s):

    http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7004/6782948429_1fa6396216.jpg

  * Alternatively, manually enter the folder path using the "Manual Entry" button.
  * Click on "Advanced" in order to select the custom scanner (SageTV Scanner)

    http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7035/6782948529_ec5006fa4d.jpg

  *  and metadata agent (SageTV BMT Agent)  for SageTV.

  * Multiple SageTV recording folders can be added to a single section by using the Add button:

    http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/6782948739_822878f981.jpg

  * And finally, click on "Add Section"

Plex will immediately start scanning the SageTV recordings folder(s); reload the page in order to see the "spinner" indicating the scan status:

Depending on the number of recordings it may take an hour or longer for all the files to be scanned and for the the Plex Media Server media database to be populated with SageTV metadata.

From a Plex client, this new section will show up with the same name assigned to it:

=== Set Movies for Scanning ===

Use the same steps to:

  * Add a new section, selecting Movies
  * Add the SageTV recording folder(s)
  * Use the Advanced button and 
    * Select SageTV Movie Scanner for the Media Scanner
    * Keep the default Freebase for the Primary Metadata Agent
  * Click Add Section and Plex will be immediately begin scanning the SageTV recordings folder(s) for movies!


== How to Apply Updates ==

(forthcoming)

== Troubleshooting ==

There are two log files in the Logs folder in the Plex Media Server folder that may provide clues to any issues that might arise:

  * Plex Media Server\Logs\Plex Media Scanner.log
  * Plex Media Server\Logs\PMS Plugin Logs\com.plexapp.agents.bmtagent.log (and previous logs, .1, .2, etc)
